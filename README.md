Payment module for Paysto and OpenCart 2.3

 Orders were created in the previous version of the module, but were not confirmed as the signature was incorrectly calculated.  Also improved performance and added new functionality.  Read all installation tools in the Instruction.docx file.

 We want to pay attention to that the module is only for the OpenCart 2.3 branch, for other branches and versions - their modules.

 If an error occurs as a result of installing and holding a payment transaction:

 Warning: FSOCKOPEN () EXPECTS PARAMETER 2 TO BE LONG, STRING GIVEN IN /..../SYSTEM/LIBRARY/mail.php on line 167

 This denotes what you need to register all mail settings (Sendmail or SMTP).
